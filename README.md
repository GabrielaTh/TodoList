# Recall todo list 
----------------------
### Technologies
To make it through this exercice, you will need to use the following technologies.
* HTML_CSS_JS
* Ajax (fetch)
* Node.js Express
* Mongoose
* JWT

### Statement
Your mission if you wish to accept it will be to create a full pledge online todo list. This is the sequence: A user can sign up then sign in to authenticate himself on the platform (mail + password). A user will then be able to access his todo list. There, the user can ADD a new todo, UPDATE the todo to change the text, DELETE a todo when it’s done.

You will have to use a REST API for your backend to store your data.
And you will only need two Schema models.
Don’t forget to use JWT to secure your routes.


### Bonuses
Set your todo application in production with Heroku (for the backend) and git page for your front.
